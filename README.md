### How to Use

Simply move the sliders to control the different aspects of the generated artwork. The canvas will update in real-time.

*   **Shape Type:** Switches between different geometric primitives (Lines, Curves, Circles, etc.).
*   **Shape Count:** Controls how many shapes are drawn on the canvas.
*   **Detail Level:** Changes the complexity of each shape. Low values create simple forms, high values create intricate ones.
*   **Color Palette:** Shifts the entire color mood of the artwork.
*   **Line Gradients:** Controls the number of color stops in each shape's gradient.
*   **Noise / Distortion:** Adds a layer of colored grain and makes the shapes more jagged and chaotic.
*   **Background:** Changes the complexity of the random radial gradient in the background.
