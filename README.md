### A Modern UI/UX Design Experiment ###

This project is more than just an app. It's a small experiment exploring the future possibilities in UI/UX design and development. The workflow was:

1.  Concept in Google Stitch: The initial UI and design vision.
2.  The Static Design was sent to Figma for refinement and future improvement.
3.  Functional Prototyping with Gemini: The static code was brought to life by collaborating with Google's Gemini, which implemented the core generative art logic, interactivity, and advanced features like high-resolution saving.

This showcases a powerful workflow for rapidly moving from a design concept to a fully functional, interactive web prototype.

### HOW TO USE ###

Simply move the sliders to control the different aspects of the generated artwork. The canvas will update in real-time.

*   Shape Type: Switches between different geometric primitives (Lines, Curves, Circles, etc.).
*   Shape Count: Controls how many shapes are drawn on the canvas.
*   Detail Level: Changes the complexity of each shape. Low values create simple forms, high values create intricate ones.
*   Color Palette: Shifts the entire color mood of the artwork.
*   Line Gradients: Controls the number of color stops in each shape's gradient.
*   Noise / Distortion: Adds a layer of colored grain and makes the shapes more jagged and chaotic.
*   Background: Changes the complexity of the random radial gradient in the background.
